Test Plan

To test the robustness and usability of our code we first tested if it could walk through a directory.

Walking Through a Directory
-Created a directory called test with assorted files and subdirectories
-Printed out path names to show that the program was indeed traversing through the directory


Example Output:
  test/.                 test/..                test/blah             test/blah/.             test/blah/..           test/blah/sadas.txt     test/boo.txt      test/interestingname.txt




Secondly we had to test if the program could successfully tokenize and if our data structure was effective in storage and retrieval

Tokenization and Insertion
-To test tokenization the indexer was given a single ascii file as input with assorted tokens with a mix of alphanumeric and non-alphanumeric tokens.
-We had the tokens inputted into the tree and then returned as printed output.
-The tree was able successfully insert tokens from the tokenizer.



Finally we tested if the program could write to an output  file in the desired format

Tree Traversal and Writing to Output file
-Instead of having the tokens print out as with the last test, we made the program write the tokens into a file
-To check for correctness, we observed the output file to see if the correct amount of tokens were printed and if the tokens were in sorted order
